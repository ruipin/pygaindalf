## 2. ✨ Status

> *"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."* - Gandalf

`pygaindalf` is currently a work-in-progress, a glimmer in the wizard's eye, and **not yet ready for production use**.

Expect rapid development, breaking changes, and ongoing improvements. This README will evolve as the project grows.

### 2.1. Goals

`pygaindalf` aims to:

- 🧾 **Import** data from multiple brokers, CSVs, APIs, and other mystical sources.
- 💱 **Convert** all values to GBP using trusted oracles (HMRC spot rates, forex APIs, etc.).
- 📚 **Apply complex CGT rules**: S104 matching, bed & breakfast, ERI adjustments, and other sorcery.
- 📤 **Export** results to `.yaml`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.xls`, `.txt` and others, as well as formats accepted by tools like [cgtcalculator.com](https://cgtcalculator.com).
- 💾 **Save & restore** the full calculation state between tax years - no need to re-slay old dragons.
- 📈 **Track** your holdings over time, across accounts, currencies, and securities.
- 🧩 **Support multiple calculation engines and strategies** - e.g., different rounding modes or FIFO vs HMRC rules.
- ⚙️ **Be composable** - built from small, swappable, and testable components you can easily extend.
- 🔍 **Be transparent** - every step traceable, every transformation explainable.
- 🇬🇧 Focus firmly on **UK-specific tax laws** and HMRC guidelines.

### 2.2. Philosophy

`pygaindalf` intends to make CGT automation:

- **Declarative**: Sane, declarative YAML configs instead of tangled scripts or spreadsheet rage.
- **Modular**: Small, reusable, easily tested building blocks.
- **Extensible**: Plug in your own magic to tailor calculations to your unique needs.
- **Transparent**: Traceable, auditable calculations for peace of mind.

## 3. 🚀 Installation

### 3.1. Requirements

- Python 3.13 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### 3.2. Installing dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. 🧪 Running Tests

To run the test suite using pytest, simply execute:

```sh
pytest
```

This will discover and run all tests in the `test/` directory.

### 4.1. Filtering Tests

You can filter which tests to run using pytest's `-k` and `-m` options:

- To run only tests with a specific mark (e.g., `@pytest.mark.logging`):
  ```sh
  pytest -m logging
  ```
- To run tests whose names match a substring or expression:
  ```sh
  pytest -k "expression"
  ```

See the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/mark.html) for more details.
